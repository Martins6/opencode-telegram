2026-07-05-21-42 | Added photo support to the Telegram bot - downloads photos, stores them under `<workspace>/downloads/images/`, and forwards a `File located at: <path>\n\nUser message: <caption>` prompt to OpenCode (audio/voice/document/video/sticker still ignored)
2026-07-05-22-00 | Upgraded default model from MiniMax-M2.7 (and M2.5 in docs) to MiniMax-M3 across `internal/config/config.go`, `internal/bot/handlers.go`, `internal/bot/notifier.go`, README example, and `feat-opencode-run-integration.md`
2026-07-07-10-26 | Renamed project from `opencode-telegram` to `acolyte` (GitHub repo, local folder, Go module path, binary name, workspace dir, OpenCode agent name, install scripts, CI, embedded workspace templates, docs). Clean break, no data migration.
2026-07-07-10-26 | Added timestamped filenames for downloaded Telegram media - new `GenerateTimestampedFilename(dir, ext)` helper in `internal/media/downloader.go` produces UTC-stamped names (`20060102_150405.jpg`) with `_1`/`_2` collision suffixes; `GetFilePath` now takes an extension instead of a filename; removed obsolete `FilenameFromTelegramPath` helper and its test.
2026-07-07-12-11 | Added self-update feature - `acolyte update`/`version` subcommands with SHA256-verified GitHub Releases replacement of the running binary, optional in-process restart, ad-hoc codesign on macOS, and a non-blocking 5s startup outdated-check in `acolyte start` that drops a row into the notifications table. Also extends `.github/workflows/release.yml` to publish a `checksums.txt`.
2026-07-13-21-58 | Extended Telegram bot media support from photos-only to all five attachment types (photo, document, audio, voice, video). Added `media.MediaMetadata` struct, `media.ExtractFileRef` helper, and richer `media.BuildPrompt(path, meta, caption)` signature in `internal/media/downloader.go`. Refactored `internal/bot/handlers.go` DefaultHandler to use a private `processMediaAttachment` helper that handles all media types through one path. Stickers, contacts, and locations remain unsupported. Added 11 new unit tests covering the new helpers and prompt format.
2026-07-30-14-33 | Added GitHub Actions OpenCode workflow - new `.github/workflows/opencode.yml` triggers on `issue_comment`/`pull_request_review_comment` events when the comment body matches ` /oc`, `/oc`, ` /opencode`, or `/opencode`, then runs `anomalyco/opencode/github@latest` against the repo using `model: minimax-coding-plan/MiniMax-M3` and the `MINIMAX_API_KEY` secret.
